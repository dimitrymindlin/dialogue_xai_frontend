                Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that impacts the daily life of people -
                in diabetes diagnosis!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Have you ever considered the impact of AI and machine learning in the healthcare sector,
                particularly in diagnosing chronic diseases like diabetes? This is where the innovative world of
                machine learning shows its true potential. <br/><br/>

                In this exploration, you will discover how machine learning models are employed to analyze extensive
                health data to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. These models act as high-tech
                analysts, scrutinizing a person's medical history and lifestyle factors to make accurate diagnoses.
                <br/><br/>

                By examining variables such as age, weight and blood sugar levels, these AI systems identify patterns
                and can now more accurately predict the risk of diabetes in patients, aiding in early detection and
                management of the condition.<br/>

                <br/>
            </p>
        </Step>
        <Step>
            <p>For example, given a person with the following information (attributes):</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Age: 34 </span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- BMI: 24.6</span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Blood Pressure: 80 mmHg</span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Diabetes Pedigree Function: 0.856</span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Glucose Level: 107 mg/dL</span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Insulin Level: 0 ÂµU/mL</span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Number of Pregnancies: 8</span></li>
                <li><span class="flex-auto">- Skin Thickness: 0 mm</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The model would give the prediction that this person is unlikely to have diabetes.
            </p>
        </Step>
        <Step>
            <h2 class="text-2xl">Study Introduction</h2>
            <h3 class="text-xl">How will the model predict the risk level of different patients?</h3>
            <p>
                The experiment is structured as follows: <br>
                1. You will be shown one patient at a time, and your task is to make an initial guess about
                how the ML model would decide for that person. <br>

                2. Then, you will see what the AI model predicts for the patient
                {#if study_group === 'interactive'}
                    {study_group_interactive_text}
                {:else}
                    {study_group_static_text}
                {/if}
                If you are done with looking at explanations, click on "Next".<br/>

                3. After you had time to understand the prediction, the next step requires you to say how the model
                will predict for a new patient. <br/>
                4. You will repeat this process for 5 patients. <br/>

                5. Finally, we will ask you a few questions about your understanding of the model. <br/>
                <br
                />

                Here, the goal isn't to be right about whether someone has diabetes or not. It's
                all about estimating what the model would predict based on the explanations you see.
                <br/><br/>

        </Step>
        <Step>
            <p>
                Before we begin, we would like to gather some information about you to ensure a diverse set
                of participants and the representativeness of the study. <br
            /><br/>

                Personal information (questions 1-4) will not be used to evaluate the results. It will
                be anonymized and randomized, so that there is no way to link it back to you and your answers in the
                study.
