				Welcome to our study on understanding decisions and the behavior of machine learning models

				Before we begin, we would like to gather information about you that will help us better
				understand the representativeness of our study and have a diverse set of participants. <br
				/><br />

				The personal information (questions 1-4) will not be used to evaluate the results. It will
				be anonymized and randomized after the study is done, so that there is no way to link it
				back to you and your answers in the study.

				Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that impacts the daily life of people -
				in credit risk assessments!
			</h2>
			<p>
				Have you ever wondered how banks and financial institutions determine who they can trust to
				borrow money? Well, that's where the power of AI and machine learning comes into play! <br
				/><br />

				In this experiment, you gain access to explore how machine learning algorithms help analyze
				vast amounts of historical data to predict whether an individual is likely to repay a loan
				or poses a higher credit risk. It's like a virtual detective that carefully examines an
				applicant's financial background and behaviors to make informed decisions. <br /><br />

				By analyzing characteristics like age, gender, and job level, the AI identified patterns and
				can now assess the likelihood of someone being a high-risk customer for new loan
				applications.
				<br />
			</p>
			<p>For example, given an applicant with the following attributes:</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Age Group: 30 </span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Gender: Male</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Job Level: Skilled</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Housing Type: Free</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Saving accounts: Moderate</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Checking account: Moderate</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Credit Amount: 2862 DM</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Credit Duration: 36 months</span></li>
				<li><span class="flex-auto">- Credit Purpose: Car</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The model would give the prediction that this is a <b>high risk</b> customer, meaning that it
				is likely that the applicant will not repay the loan in time.
			</p>
		</Step>
		<Step>
			<h2 class="text-2xl">Study Introduction</h2>
			<h3 class="text-xl">How will the model predict the risk level of new applicants?</h3>
			<p>
				You will be shown one applicant at a time, and your task is to make an initial guess about
				how the ML model would decide for that applicant. Then, you will see the models prediction
				and you can ask questions about the prediction and how the model works to understand it
				better. As you learn more, you can update your initial guess if you want. If you are sure
				about your guess, click on "Next" to see the next applicant and repeat the process.<br /><br
				/>

				Here, the goal isn't to be right about whether someone is a high or low risk customer. It's
				all about estimating what the model would predict based on the questions you can ask.
				<br /><br />

				You'll do this for eight applicants. After you're done, we'll ask you a few questions about
				your understanding of the model and it's decision where you will get extra money for correct
				answers. Afterward, we're curious to hear what you think about the questions, answers, and
				how well you could predict the model's behavior. Let's get started!
